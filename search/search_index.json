I am a first-year graduate student in physics at McGill University pursuing my MSc under the supervision of Prof. William Coish.

Science is cool and interesting and scientific literacy and awareness among the public is invaluable to our society. For the time being, check out the YouTube channel of Sabine Hossenfelder, whose content I am quite fond of, albeit often pessimistic.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p> I grew up in Winnipeg, MB, Canada (born 3 September 2002) and attended St. Paul's High School. Here, I developed my passion for science and my overall motivation to succeed academically. I was then lucky enough to receive a scholarship to study at Western University in London, ON. I chose the Integrated Science program because it allowed me to be exposed to all areas of science and how they interconnect with each other and with society at large. It also allowed me to simultaneously pursue a specialization in any scientific discipline, of which I chose physics due to its ability to fuel my curiosity as well as my mathematical inclinations. </p> <p>I later became fascinated by quantum mechanics, and in particular, quantum computing. The way that these counterintuitive quantum phenomena could be harnessed for a potentially revolutionary technology was incredibly intriguing to me. I began to immerse myself in the field, and was later introduced to the more general field of condensed matter physics, where quantum mechanics is applied to study materials and their properties. I spent two summers with Prof. Jesko Sirker at the University of Manitoba where we studied the phenomenon of many-body localization (or the lack thereof... see here for more information). In addition, I spent a year with Prof. Mahi Singh at Western where I was introduced to the field of plasmonics. This all led me to pursue a Master of Science degree at McGill University in theoretical condensed matter physics with Prof. Bill Coish, where I currently reside. I plan to pursue a PhD after the completion of my Master's, and hopefully become a research scientist in computational and theoretical quantum physics.</p>"},{"location":"about/#vita","title":"Vita","text":"<p>2024-Present: MSc, McGill University</p> <p>2020-2024: BSc, Western University</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<p> My beautiful dog, Gracie</p> <p>When not at the office, there's a good chance you'll find me at the track.

Currently I train with McGill's varsity team, but previously I was on Western's varsity team as well as Winnipeg Optimist Athletics. Despite the tremendous commitment of time and energy, typically spending 2 or more hours per day training throughout the entire year, the sport has become an incredible passion of mine, and I have high aspirations for myself. Additionally, the sport has brought me some of my fondest memories and closest friends, and it has taught me great lessons about dealing with adversity in the pursuit of a goal.</p> <p>Unfortunately, each of my competition seasons have been plagued with injury since 2022. However, I hope to make a grand comeback in 2025. My current personal bests stand at 7.32m in the long jump (achieved in June 2024) and 14.92 in the triple jump (achieved in August 2022). For the latter, I received a bronze medal at the 2022 Canada Summer Games for Team Manitoba. In 2025, I plan to compete in the USports (Canadian University) National Championships, the Canadian Senior National Championships, and the 2025 Canada Summer Games. </p>      ![Track 1](/docs/about/media/track1.JPG)     ![Track 2](/docs/about/media/track2.JPG)     ![Track 3](/docs/about/media/track3.PNG)"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>In addition to my primary research projects, I hope to further develop to further develop my skills in computational science with projects.
