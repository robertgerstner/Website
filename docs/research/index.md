# Research Activities

My primary area of interest can be broadly classified as **theoretical and computational quantum many-body physics**. I am interested in applying known theoretical/mathematical tools as well as computational tools (including neural networks and quantum computation) for studying quantum systems with potential applications. 

Click [here](./pubs.md) for a list of my publications, or check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=TYEYABoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Below are some highlighted research projects I have been involved with.

## Shortcuts to the Many-Body Problem with Machine Learning

My current MSc project under the supervision of Prof. [Bill Coish](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~coish/). As the project is still in its infancy with no published results, I will refrain from explaining the details for now.

## Many-Body Localization

A project I worked on during undergrad with Prof. [Jesko Sirker](http://drop.physics.umanitoba.ca/~jsirker/Dokuwiki/doku.php?id=home). We attacked the problem of many-body localization from a new lens of operator growth, finding strong evidence that the phenomenon does not exist. Read more about it [here](./highlights/MBL/index.md).

## Harmonic Generation in Metallic Nanohybrids

My undergraduate honours thesis project with Prof. [Mahi Singh](https://physics.uwo.ca/~msingh/). We developed a theory for harmonic generation in certain types of metallic nanohybrids. Read more about it [here](./highlights/Harm_Gen/index.md).
