# Projects

In addition to my primary research, I hope to further develop to further develop my skills in computational science with projects. Below are some highlighted examples.

## Crystal Band Structure and Graph Theory

I am currently working on a project which numerically studies the relationship between spectral graph theory and the band structures of one-dimensional periodic crystals for the class Physics 558 at McGill. Once finished, I will include a link to a GitHub repo, Jupyter notebook, and/or written report.

## IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022

In the fall of 2022, I participated in the IBM Quantum Challenge. This was a programming challenge in Qiskit in which participants solved problems in quantum optimization, quantum machine learning, and quantum chemistry. I was one of 594 participants to successfully complete every problem out of over 1600 total participants. My Advanced Badge for this feat can be seen [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/cfbd99aa-2bab-44b7-bdba-4e430ff478e6/linked_in_profile).
