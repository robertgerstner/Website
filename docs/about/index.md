# Introduction

I grew up in Winnipeg, MB, Canada (born September 3, 2002) and attended St. Paul's High School from 2016-2020. Here, I developed my passion for science and my overall motivation to succeed academically. I was then lucky enough to receive a [scholarship](https://registrar.uwo.ca/student_finances/scholarships_awards/admission/national_scholarship_program.html) to study at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html) in London, ON. I chose the [Integrated Science](https://uwo.ca/sci/wisc/index.html) program because it allowed me to be exposed to all areas of science and how they interconnect with each other and with society at large. It also allowed me to simultaneously pursue a specialization in any scientific discipline, of which I chose physics due to its ability to fuel my curiosity as well as my mathematical inclinations. 

I later became fascinated by quantum mechanics, and in particular, quantum computing. The way that counterintuitive quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement could be harnessed for a potentially revolutionary technology was incredibly intriguing to me. I began to immerse myself in the field. Later, I was introduced condensed matter physics, where quantum mechanics is applied to study materials and their properties. One thing I love about condensed matter is its versatility; the work ranges abstract mathematical theory all the way to practical real-world applications. I spent two summers with Prof. [Jesko Sirker](http://drop.physics.umanitoba.ca/~jsirker/Dokuwiki/doku.php?id=home) at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/) where we studied the phenomenon of many-body localization (or the lack thereof... see [here](/docs/research/highlights/MBL/index.md) for more information). In addition, I spent a year with Prof. [Mahi Singh](https://physics.uwo.ca/~msingh/) at Western where I was introduced to the field of plasmonics. This all led me to pursue a Master of Science degree at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in theoretical condensed matter physics with Prof. [Bill Coish](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~coish/), where I currently reside. After the completion of my MSc, I plan to pursue a PhD degree and hopefully become a research scientist in computational/theoretical physics.

When not at the office, there's a good chance you'll find me at the track. I am a competitive track and field athlete in the long and triple jump and you can learn more about this [here](./track.md).

As an active music nerd, I enjoy playing the piano and I am obsessed with keeping up with new album releases. I typically make an album of the year ranking at the end of each year. Stay tuned for 2024...

I am also a big NBA fan. As a Canadian, the Toronto Raptors have always been my number one, but the Oklahoma City Thunder have also become a recent favourite.
