![Headshot1](/docs/home_media/headshot1.jpg){align = "left": style = "height:150;width:150px"} Welcome! I am a first-year graduate student in physics at McGill University pursuing my MSc under the supervision of Prof. William Coish. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical and computational many-body physics. Understanding and simulating complex quantum systems allows for a range of applications from materials science and chemistry to quantum computation.

Feel free to read more [about me](./about/index.md), my [research](./research/index.md), and some further [projects](./projects/index.md) I've been working on.
