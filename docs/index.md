Welcome! I am a first-year graduate student in physics at McGill University pursuing my MSc under the supervision of Prof. William Coish. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical and computational many-body physics. Understanding and simulating complex quantum systems allows for a range of applications from materials science and chemistry to quantum computation.

Feel free to read more [about me](./about/about.md), my [research](./research/research_index.md), and some further [projects](./projects/project_index.md) I've been working on.
